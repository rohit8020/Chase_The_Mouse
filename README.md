# Chase_The_Mouse
This is a fun little project, in which we can see colourful mouse movements.

This project is made with html, vanilla javascript and css. We are creating the 5000 divs and whenever we are making an mouse event 
it gives a random colour to the hovered div and div becomes transparent after sometime(for that we are using the setTimeout function which makes the div colour transparent).
